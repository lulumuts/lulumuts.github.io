          <h2 span class="header">About me!</span></h2>
          <p>I'm Lulu, and I am a Fashion Designer based in Nairobi. I went to University at SCAD, which is a university for creative careers, in Savannah, Georgia.
             After graduation I moved to New York City to find work for a year. I have worked as an intern in Contemporary womenswear brands, I worked as a personal stylist
             in a french boutique, and before that I worked as a docent or tour guide in the school art museum. SCAD museum hosted many notable names in the art world and was
             a great opportunity learn how to speak infront of people.</p>
          <p>I am currently working on launching my fashion brand AMILO this year, and create a new collection inspired by Afrofuturism.</p>
          <p>I decided to join Moringa because I have been talking about learning how to code for over a year, and finally decided to do it! I am
           hoping to use the skills to freelance as a website developer, and together with my design degree, create beautiful website and apps.</p>
