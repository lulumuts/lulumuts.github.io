    <h2>About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm Lulu, and I am a Fashion Designer based in Nairobi. I went to University at SCAD,
    which is a university for creative careers, in Savannah, Georgia. After graduation I moved to New York City to find work for a year.
    I have worked as an intern in Contemporary womenswear brands, I worked as a personal stylist in a french boutique, and before that I
    worked as a docent or tour guide in the school art museum. SCAD museum hosted many notable names in the art world and was a great opportunity
    learn how to speak infront of people.</p>
    <p>I am currently working on launching my fashion brand AMILO this year, and create a new collection inspired by Afrofuturism.</p>
    <p>I decided to join Moringa because I have been talking about learning how to code for over a year, and finally decided to do it! I am
    hoping to use the skills to freelance as a website developer, and together with my design degree, create beautiful website and apps.</p>
