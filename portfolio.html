    <p>This project was made to practice using block elements on HTML, paying attention to indentation and spacing. And of course, using Git.</p>
    <h3>Weird-name</h3>
    <p>This project was originally called "Hello-World", and changed the name as part of pratice on command-line prompts. Specifically on re-naming files.
