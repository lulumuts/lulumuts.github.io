### Description
#####  This website showcases the work that has been done so far in Moringa School. It has examples of certain projects that link to GitHub. It has an image linked and unordered lists describing the project objectives met thus far.
### Setup/Installation Requirements *
##### This was written in html. I used bootstrap.css for some general style features, and included my own stylesheet on styles.CSS
### Issue-
##### No issues except for in creating the repository, there was an initial READme on GitHub that needed to link to the local folder, and so I rebased the repository so that I was hence able to push to GitHub.

### Technologies Used
##### I used HTML and CSS to create this and used spans and div classes to do some of the styling. I also used jumbotron styling which is a feature used on bootstrap.

### Support and contact details
##### If you have any problems with the website, feel free to contact me on lulumutuli24@gmail.com
